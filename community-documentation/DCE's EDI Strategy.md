DATA CENTRIC ENGINEERING PROGRAMME EQUALITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION STRATEGY

1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	The Programme Manager and Senior Research Community Manager have been jointly leading on the development of a programme-specific strategy for equality, diversity and inclusion. 

1.2	This is the first programme-specific strategy developed in the Turing. The project leads have been working closely with the Turing’s EDI Strategy Lead to develop the strategy. The strategy has been presented to the Turing’s EDI Advisory Group and received very positive feedback.


2.	CONSIDERATION

2.1	An outline of the strategy and the work to date is included at Annex A.

2.2	One of the initial external activities that the programme is planning to do is a data benchmarking exercise, to gather baseline data on diversity within the DCE community. The plan is to issue an online survey, and to hold some in-person focus groups. The programme is hopeful that external stakeholders will support the activity, to encourage dissemination and reach. 



 
Annex A
Data-Centric Engineering and Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: Developing a programme-specific plan


1. Introduction

The Data-Centric Engineering (DCE) Programme at The Alan Turing Institute is committed to fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment where open and collaborative research thrives. This document presents a series of discussions that are taking place,  actions initiated within the programme and strides towards making equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) integral part of DCE. It outlines our strategic approach to embedding EDI principles into the DCE programme's activities, operational modes, and community engagement. This strategy aligns with The Alan Turing Institute’s broader EDI objectives and aims to address the specific challenges and opportunities within the DCE programme.

2.	DCE’s vision for EDI

DCE’s vision is to create a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment that fosters a strong culture of collaborative research. This vision is grounded in the belief that a collaborative and diverse community is essential for solving complex engineering challenges and that inclusivity is crucial for ensuring that all voices contribute to the programme's success.

3.	Strategic Goals for EDI in DCE

The Alan Turing Institute’s EDI strategy is structured around seven key objectives which focus on its role as a national body, research institute, employer and other EDI commitments. DCE’s EDI strategy is designed to align with these objectives, emphasising the importance of EDI as a key principle in the institute’s mission of using technology for public good and building inclusive career pathways.

The DCE programme has identified these strategic goals:

DCE as a national and international leader in its field

•	Leading a step change in engineering
Goal: Become a leader in fostering and sharing EDI practices in engineering.
•	Creating an Inclusive and Supportive Community
Goal: Foster a welcoming environment where all individuals feel valued. Support a diverse population of practitioners. Promote variety of career pathways.
•	Measuring and Reporting on EDI Progress
Goal: Establish clear metrics and reporting mechanisms to track progress toward EDI objectives.

DCE as a research programme

•	Embedding EDI Principles into DCE Operations and Research
Goal: Integrate EDI considerations into all aspects of DCE’s operations and research activities. 


DCE as a team

•	Inclusive Leadership
Goal: Empower all members of the programme to feel capable of leading.
•	Equal Voice
Goal: Ensure that every member has an equal voice in contributing to the programme’s vision and activities.

4.	Opportunities for Advancing EDI in DCE

The DCE programme and the DCE discipline present unique opportunities to enhance EDI:
•	Diverse Roles and Entry Routes: The programme and the discipline include a wide range of roles at various levels, offering diverse entry routes that could attract a more diverse intake.
•	International Outreach and Inclusion: In alignment with Lloyd’s Register Foundation’s continuous efforts for internationalisation, and support from the Turing, the programme is coordinating with regional Foreign and Commonwealth Development Offices (FCDOs) from countries of interest, in identifying areas for potential action, based on requests from those countries’ researchers. The partnership between the DCE Programme and the Data-Centric Engineering journal on the theme of open research and inclusion, which looks at engaging with researchers from the Global South, presents opportunities to integrate global perspectives and promote inclusion in research.
•	Building on Existing Strengths: The inherent diversity of disciplines within DCE, including inputs from engineering to humanities and vice-versa, provides a solid foundation for enhancing EDI.

5.	Challenges in the Data-Centric Engineering discipline 

Broadly, engineering disciplines present a less diverse and inclusive landscape than other fields (Royal Academy of Engineering, 2023) in terms of gender and ethnic diversity. Data-centric engineering is likely to face challenges like other engineering disciplines, in furthering diversity and inclusion. The DCE programme is running a survey  to provide some benchmark diversity data within the discipline, and to identify these challenges and surface those areas where the programme can contribute to advance its vision for EDI. This study will seek the involvement of Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the Royal Academy of Engineering and will target the DCE team, programme and community within and beyond national borders. 

6.	Community Engagement and Inclusivity

To build an inclusive DCE community, the following strategies will be implemented:
•	Inclusive Environment: Foster a sense of belonging through inclusive policies and practices.
•	Mentorship and Support: Establish effective mentorship initiatives to support diverse talent.
•	Community Engagement: Engage with local communities to promote STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education and widen participation in DCE.
•	Widening Participation: Inspire the next generation of DCE engineers through targeted outreach and engagement activities.
•	Accountability: Implement regular evaluations of inclusivity efforts and adjust based on feedback.

7.	Laying the Foundations for Long-term Success

The first year of the DCE EDI plan will focus on establishing strong foundational practices:

•	Operational Integration: EDI considerations will be embedded into all operational aspects, including research activities, recruitment, and community engagement.
•	Training and Development: All team members will undergo EDI-related training, with a focus on practical application within their roles.
•	Regular Feedback: The DCE Programme Director will maintain open communication channels with all team members to continuously refine and improve EDI efforts.

The programme will then look to build on these foundations.

8.	Objectives and Action Plan

The following objectives have been defined for a 0-12 month period, along with associated actions:

8.1	DCE as a national and international leader in its field 

•	Objective: Understand the DCE EDI landscape.
•	Actions:
o	Landscape mapping of other organisations and activities in the DCE/EDI space.
o	Community discussions on DCE/EDI to support landscape mapping and prioritisation.
o	Agree priority EDI areas for DCE to focus on (first area agreed as gender diversity in marine and maritime engineering).
o	Develop a process for gathering relevant diversity data for the programme.
o	Benchmark DCE’s EDI efforts against similar programmes.

8.2	DCE as a Research Programme

•	Objective: Embed EDI principles into research activities.
•	Actions:
o	Ensure that programme research is open-sourced where appropriate.
o	Ensure that programme research is assessed as ethical.
o	Ensure that good programme research practices are shared through The Turing Way or elsewhere as appropriate.
o	Establish regular collection of diversity data for events of an appropriate size.
o	Explore options for access funding offered by the Data-Centric Engineering journal and how to promote this scheme.
o	Equality impact assessments to be built into operational process for all relevant activity.

8.3	DCE as a team 

•	Objective: Embedding EDI principles and processes into working practices and management.
•	Actions:
o	Establish a regular series of community meetings that offer all participants the chance to input. 
o	Measure current views of inclusivity on the programme and obtain suggestions for improvements.
o	Ensure all postdoctoral research associates have clear line management with a seconded person.
o	Programme Director to establish regular catchups with all team members.

o	Ensure all team members undertake equality impact assessment (EIA) training.
o	Establish EDI considerations in the recruitment process.
o	Regularly collect diversity data and feedback on inclusivity.
o	EDI reporting and relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) established.

8.4	Measuring Progress and Accountability

•	Objective: Implement mechanisms to measure and evaluate progress in EDI.
•	Actions:
o	Develop a roadmap for EDI progress with short, medium, and long-term goals.
o	Regularly assess community views on inclusivity.
o	Establish EDI reporting and KPIs.

9.	Sharing Best Practices / Lessons learned

To effectively share lessons learned from DCE’s implementation of its EDI strategy, we will establish a communication and collaboration approach that engages:

•	internal stakeholders: the Research Community Managers team at the Turing, EDI Turing. 
•	external stakeholders: individuals in roles pertaining to community management.
•	
This may include cross-departmental workshops where successful EDI initiatives are showcased, encouraging the exchange of ideas and strategies. Internal platforms for knowledge sharing (Programme Management Unit blog and lunch and learn). We will also insert a section on DCE’s webpage that signposts DCE’s EDI strategy. EDI documentation will be stored in DCE’s Github repository where resources, case studies, and guidelines can be easily accessed and shared. Furthermore, we will initiate a regular EDI section in DCE newsletter featuring insights, challenges, and practical tips from various activities. By creating these opportunities for open discussions and resource sharing, we aim to ensure that EDI practices are firmly embedded in Data-Centric Engineering as a community but also discipline.

Replicating programme approach

The programme presents characteristics that are specific to it, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement in actioning EDI’s principles: 

•	A Programme Director vocally supportive and leading by example
•	Main funder, Lloyd’s Register Foundation, actively supportive of openness and inclusion
•	Team background and experience 
•	Available funding 
•	Resource split between Programme Manager, Senior Research Community Manager, Theme Leads
•	Diverse professional trajectories within the data-centric engineering discipline
•	A global geographic scope that favours inclusion

Some lessons that can instead be shared and replicated across the Turing could include: 

•	Embedding openness into regular workflow, shared resources and templates
•	Building EDI into reporting and operational planning
•	Articulating current EDI activity (recruitment, equality impact assessments, open sourcing)
•	Pushing message that EDI is a collective responsibility
•	Prioritisation and being realistic
•	Grand Challenges – focus on problem solving rather than technical skills
•	Writing into grants

10.	Next Steps

The next initiatives include:

1.	Benchmarking Data Collection: Collaborate with the EDI team to gather baseline data on diversity within the DCE community and external stakeholders.
2.	Focused EDI Projects: Begin a pilot project to address gender diversity in the Marine and Maritime Engineering theme, exploring potential collaborations and interventions.

11.	Conclusion

This document provides an overview of DCE programme’s EDI strategy, highlighting the importance of a structured approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities within the discipline. The outlined objectives and action plans are designed to create a more inclusive and diverse environment that reflects the values of The Alan Turing Institute and the broader data-centric engineering community.
The DCE programme is committed to lead in making EDI a cornerstone of its activities, embedding it in the programme’s operational modes and fostering a diverse and inclusive environment. By implementing the outlined strategy, the DCE programme aims to not only subscribe to The Turing’s EDI objectives, but further, ensure that all members of the DCE community can contribute and thrive.
