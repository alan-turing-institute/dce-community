# Data-Centric Engineering Community (DCE Community)

Welcome to the community repository for The Alan Turing [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). Here, you will find the community documentation and related information from DCE.

Our mission is to __Bring together world-leading academic institutions and major industrial partners from across the engineering sector, to address new challenges in data-centric engineering.__ 

As an innovative research and knowledge program, DCE thrives on its ability to unite individuals, making community management and building a cornerstone of its success. Positioned as one of its four strategic pillars, community engagement in DCE is both a goal and a driving force behind DCE's generative function. The art of cultivating and sustaining the DCE community begins with stakeholder mapping to help us identify who is in the DCE community and its broader ecosystem. We have further mapped where people interact and how, as well as the opportunities we can leverage to strengthen international stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and the long-term impact of DCE in the UK and worldwide. Stakeholders mapping has led to a journey of understanding the current state, such as the structural composition of the community, interaction patterns, and ways of working. The current state has further allowed us to ask questions such as our desired ways of working, how we can evolve and open our operational modes, and what impact we want to have in our community and the broader society.

This initial piece of community documentation work has allowed us to capture the narrative of the community's present while envisioning its future trajectory with involvement from DCE leaders, researchers, and community members through 1:1 meetings and group-based discussions at community events.

üéØDCE Community Vision
---

DCE aims to develop a decentralised structure that fosters autonomy and flexibility among researchers and potentially lead to a diverse range of research directions. However, it keeps the identity of a community of practice, where members involved in research and para-research come together to share knowledge, experiences, and best practices. However, it also keeps the identity of a community of practice, where members involved in research and para-research come together to share knowledge, experiences, and best practices. 

DCE community promotes continuous learning and skill development in data-centric engineering with the underpinning values and practices of open science culture: transparency, collaboration, and sharing of research output.

üåå Community Roadmap
---

Short-term
- Map stakeholders in industry and academia to understand community expertise and needs across the research and user community 
- Facilitate networking and building connections amongst the community to help boost knowledge exchange and skills development
- Consolidate emerging international partnerships, developed during the first phase of our LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership
- Continue to promote the DCE Journal published by Cambridge University Press

Medium-term 
- Facilitate the growth of meaningful partnerships to accelerate the translation and adoption of outputs and outcomes from DCE research, particularly in safety-critical sectors
- Identify new partners that will help bring data science, AI and DCE to low-income countries, ensuring these international communities are equipped with the tools needed to adopt safe practices at the interface between data science, AI and engineering, as they grow 
- Support the creation of open-source training materials that can help upskilling in data science and AI across communities 
- Collaborate with professional bodies in engineering, by promoting the values and benefits of DCE, helping to increase data science and AI methods and tools adoption and facilitating knowledge exchange
