# Data-Centric Engineering Community (DCE-Community)

Welcome to community repository for the Alan Turing [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering)📊 Here, you will find the programme and related documentation from our community.

**The DCE community aims at growing an open, inclusive, and empowering network of affiliated members around data-centric engineering**

🎯Background 
---
Data-centric engineering encourages industries to recognise what can be achieved by utilising data at scale and adopting data-centric practices as standard.
Building on the successes of the LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership, and creation of DCE as a genuine discipline, there is the need to accelerate community building to establish a “Commonwealth of Turing Talents” which capitalises on research strengths from across the 
Turing, and also connect further into data science and engineering communities in the UK and overseas. 
DCE community crosses disciplines, sectors, and geographies, and we want it to be as  inclusive as possible. We want to expand our community so that we continue to attract the best researchers from across the UK, foster national and international collaboration. Reassessing how we 
work with universities to ensure we maximise on the UK’s full potential will be a cornerstone 
of this effort.
We also want to be flexible in meeting the growing interest from industry by working with a bigger cross-section of industry partners through a wider variety of mechanisms. We want to stimulate new investment and sectors through showcasing the latest research and acting as 
a trusted broker between industry, academia, and regulators.

🎯 Communication channels
---
- Visit [DCE website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering) for more details on the programme, our projects and the community members involved in.
- We send out a newsletter which includes the programme updates and opportunities and jobs, events and funding calls from both The Alan Turing Institute and DCE. The Turing Data-Centric Engineering (DCE) community mailing list provides regular updates on activity within the Turing DCE community and connected partners. You can sign up [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering#introduction)
- You can join our [Slack Workspace]() to connect with the team and the wider community
