# Data-Centric Engineering Community (DCE Community)

Welcome to the community repository for The Alan Turing [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). Here, you will find the community documentation and related information from DCE.

Our mission is to __Bring together world-leading academic institutions and major industrial partners from across the engineering sector, to address new challenges in data-centric engineering.__ 

As an innovative research and knowledge program, DCE thrives on its ability to unite individuals, making community management and building a cornerstone of its success. Positioned as one of its four strategic pillars, community engagement in DCE is both a goal and a driving force behind DCE's generative function.

Plans and strategies for cultivating and sustaining the DCE community in its second phase began in 2022 with stakeholder mapping, helping us identify the members of the DCE community and its broader ecosystem. 
Through one-on-one meetings, group discussions, and community events, we have mapped out where and how people interact, as well as the opportunities to strengthen international stakeholder engagement, collaboration, and the long-term impact of DCE in the UK and worldwide.

This stakeholder mapping has led to a deeper understanding of the current state, including the structural composition of the community, interaction patterns, and ways of working.
Feedback from community members on the current state has further enabled us to explore our desired ways of working, how we can evolve and open our operational modes, and the impact we aim to have within our community and the broader society.

This documentation on GitHub captures information about the community's current infrastructure and processes, developed with contributions from DCE leaders, researchers, and community members.

üéØ DCE Community Vision
---

The DCE envisions a decentralised community that empowers DCE researchers with autonomy and flexibility, enabling a diverse range of research directions to flourish.

While fostering this agency, the community remains anchored in its identity as a community of practice, where members engaged in both research and para-research unite to share knowledge, experiences, and best practices.

Our vision promotes continuous learning and skill development in data-centric engineering, guided by the core values of open science: transparency, collaboration, and the sharing of research outputs. Through this commitment, we aim to advance the field while nurturing a vibrant, inclusive, and forward-thinking community.

üåå Community Roadmap
---

**Short-term**
- Map stakeholders in industry and academia to understand community expertise and needs across the research and user community 
- Facilitate networking and building connections amongst the community to help boost knowledge exchange and skills development
- Consolidate emerging international partnerships, developed during the first phase of our LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership
- Continue to promote the DCE Journal published by Cambridge University Press

**Long-term**
- Facilitate the growth of meaningful partnerships to accelerate the translation and adoption of outputs and outcomes from DCE research, particularly in safety-critical sectors
- Identify new partners that will help bring data science, AI and DCE to low-income countries, ensuring these international communities are equipped with the tools needed to adopt safe practices at the interface between data science, AI and engineering, as they grow 
- Support the creation of open-source training materials that can help upskilling in data science and AI across communities 
- Collaborate with professional bodies in engineering, by promoting the values and benefits of DCE, helping to increase data science and AI methods and tools adoption and facilitating knowledge exchange
