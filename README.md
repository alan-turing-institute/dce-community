# Data-Centric Engineering Community (DCE Community)

Welcome to the community repository for The Alan Turing [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering). Here, you will find the community documentation and related information from DCE.

DCE is an exceptional area of research and development, with enormous opportunities to innovate through collaboration among stakeholders both at the Turing Institute and beyond. 
DCE has also fostered an array of scientific research projects that have brought together individuals with diverse knowledge and perspectives, providing opportunities for stakeholders from different sectors to collaborate on work that has a positive real-world impact.
At the heart of this is the DCE community, dedicated to cultivating **an open, inclusive, and empowering network of affiliated members around data-centric engineering**. 
Our vision is to establish a "Wealth of Talents," leveraging research strengths from across the Turing while extending our connections into the broader landscape of data science and engineering communities, both in the UK and overseas.

We aspire to create build and nurture a well-connected community that will create a conducive environment, that enables the transfer and exchange of knowledge, encourages active contributions and exemplifies proof points -- setting the stage for a thriving scientific network that fuels innovation and collaboration.

üéØBackground 
---

DCE aims to set standards, build diverse communities, and nurture researchers' interest in translational research in Data-Centric Engineering. We are an open and inclusive community that spans disciplines, sectors, and geographies. 
We are committed to expanding it through engagement with international stakeholders. 
We seek to attract and collaborate with top researchers nationwide, fostering collaboration on both national and international levels. 
A key focus is optimising and strengthening our partnership with universities to realise the full potential of AI in data-centric engineering.

DCE will work across the following programme themes: digital manufacturing, critical infrastructure, marine and maritime, energy systems and humanities, social sciences and arts. 
Our work will contribute to the Turing 2.0 Grand Challenges on Environment and Sustainability,
Defence and National Security and Health, in alignment with the Turing Institute's strategy.

Building on the DCE programme's research work, outcomes and impact in its first phase, we will continue to adapt to industry needs through collaboration with a broader range of cross-sector partners. 
In the realm of data-centric engineering, we champion the widespread adoption of open data practices, standards and skills, aiming to showcase the latest research and act as a catalyst for new investments and sectors.

üåå Community Roadmap
---

Short-term
- Map stakeholders in industry and academia to understand community expertise and needs across the research and user community 
- Facilitate networking and building connections amongst the community to help boost knowledge exchange and skills development
- Consolidate emerging international partnerships, developed during the first phase of our LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership
- Continue to promote the DCE Journal published by Cambridge University Press

Medium-term 
- Facilitate the growth of meaningful partnerships to accelerate the translation and adoption of outputs and outcomes from DCE research, particularly in safety-critical sectors
- Identify new partners that will help bring data science, AI and DCE to low-income countries, ensuring these international communities are equipped with the tools needed to adopt safe practices at the interface between data science, AI and engineering, as they grow 
- Support the creation of open-source training materials that can help upskilling in data science and AI across communities 
- Collaborate with professional bodies in engineering, by promoting the values and benefits of DCE, helping to increase data science and AI methods and tools adoption and facilitating knowledge exchange
