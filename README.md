# Data-Centric Engineering Community (DCE-Community)

Welcome to community repository for the Alan Turing [Data-Centric Engineering](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering)üìä Here, you will find the programme and related documentation from our community.

Research communities are an excellent space for fostering collaboration among internal and external stakeholders. They bring members with different knowledge perspectives together and strengthen their capacity to work and learn creatively together. Hence, **The DCE community aims at growing an open, inclusive, and empowering network of affiliated members around data-centric engineering**	by establishing a ‚ÄúCommonwealth of Talents‚Äù which capitalises on research strengths from across the Turing, and also connect further into data science and engineering communities in the UK and overseas. It is increasingly engaging and collaborating with partners both within the UK, as well as across borders, and with other major international foundations whom with there are also opportunities to collaborate with.

üéØBackground 
---
DCE wants to develop standards, grow communities and nurture researchers' interest in translation research. Data-centric engineering encourages industries to recognise what can be achieved by utilising data at scale and adopting data-centric practices as standard.
Building on the successes of the LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership, and creation of DCE as a genuine discipline, there is the need to accelerate community building to establish a ‚ÄúCommonwealth of Turing Talents‚Äù which capitalises on research strengths from across the 
Turing, and also connect further into data science and engineering communities in the UK and overseas. 
DCE community crosses disciplines, sectors, and geographies, and we want it to be as  inclusive as possible. We want to expand our community so that we continue to attract the best researchers from across the UK, foster national and international collaboration. Reassessing how we 
work with universities to ensure we maximise on the UK‚Äôs full potential will be a cornerstone 
of this effort. 
We also want to be flexible in meeting the growing interest from industry by working with a bigger cross-section of industry partners through a wider variety of mechanisms. We want to stimulate new investment and sectors through showcasing the latest research and acting as 
a trusted broker between industry, academia, and regulators.

üìü Communication channels
---
- Visit [DCE website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering) for more details on the programme, our projects and the community members involved in.
- We send out a newsletter which includes the programme updates and opportunities and jobs, events and funding calls from both The Alan Turing Institute and DCE. The Turing Data-Centric Engineering (DCE) community mailing list provides regular updates on activity within the Turing DCE community and connected partners. You can sign up [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/data-centric-engineering#introduction)
- You can join our [Slack Workspace]() to connect with the team and the wider community
- You can communicate with the whole community via dceCOMMUNITY@turing.ac.uk

üåå Community Roadmap
---

Short-term
- Map stakeholders in industry and academia to understand community expertise and needs across the research and user community 
- Facilitate networking and building connections amongst the community to help boost knowledge exchange and skills development
- Consolidate emerging international partnerships, developed during the first phase of our LRF-Turing Strategic Partnership
- Continue to promote the DCE Journal published by Cambridge University Press

Medium-term 
- Facilitate the growth of meaningful partnerships to accelerate translation and adoption of outputs and outcomes from DCE research, particularly in safety-critical sectors
- Identify new partners that will help bring data science, AI and DCE to low-income countries, ensuring these international communities are equipped with the tools needed to adopt safe practices at the interface between data science, AI and engineering, as they grow 
- Support the creation of open-source training materials that can help upskilling in data science and AI across communities 
- Collaborate with professional bodies in engineering, by promoting the values and benefits of DCE, helping to increase data science and AI methods and tools adoption and facilitate knowledge exchange
