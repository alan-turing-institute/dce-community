Welcome to our porfolio of Data-Centric-Engineering exciting projects (PAST-PRESENT-FUTURE) 

| Project / Initiative | Synopsis | DCE main stakeholders | Priority | Status | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| IEEE Conference on AI , Singapore 2024 | 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Sands Expo and Convention Centre.Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 25-27 June 2024. DCE workshop proposal has been accepted. An opportunity to bring data-centric engineering to an international stage, focusing on the dynamic region of S-E Asia | Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey; Katy | | In progress |
| SMART DESIGN NETWORK | Further refine the overall Concept and options for a Engineering Transformation Network (ETN) – renamed as Smart Design Network. The sub-committee is essentially looking at AI and HPC informing Engineering and Manufacturing. DCE's role is to look at how to bring in aspects of data-centric engineering into the network. https://www.ukri.org/publications/innovate-uk-materials-and-manufacturing-vision-2050/; https://roadmap.ide.uk/ | Drew Hemment; Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey || In Progress |
| Maritime Research and Innovation UK (MarRI-UK) | This is an industry-led membership organisation that drives the global competitiveness of the UK maritime through extensive partnerships in identifying, developing, and leveraging emerging technologies. DCE was part of a study on The UK’s Academic Capacity and Capability for Shipbuilding Report funded by the National Shipbuilding Office (NSO). The purpose of this report is to provide an insight into the UK’s current research capabilities, understand what other nations are doing and provide a series of recommendations to industry and government for enhanced competitiveness https://marri-uk.org/index.php/2023/12/13/the-uks-academic-capacity-capability-for-shipbuilding/ | Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey || Completed |
| ODEN Institute - TURING | The over-arching goal is to develop machine learning methods that are aware of the physics of the problem for the realization of real-time digital twins of engineering systems. Applications involve fluid mechanics and nonlinear partial differential equations. Physics-aware machine learning for engineering systems with fluids and nonlinear partial differential equations, while considering the real-time assimilation of data from sensors and robustness of the machine learning algorithms.| | Luca Magri; Katy Henderson ; Adam Sobey ; Gabin Kayumbi| | In Progress |
