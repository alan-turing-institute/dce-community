Welcome to this panorama of exciting initiatives, activities and projects we are involved in at DCE ! Contact us for more details. 

| Project / Initiative | Synopsis | DCE main stakeholders | Priority | Status | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| Accreditation of Data-Centric Engineering in UK universities| This initiative is about embedding data-centric engineering into engineering courses in UK universities. To ensure the successful implementation of data centric engineering, The Alan Turing Institute, Lloyds Register Foundation and the Royal Academy of Engineering believe there needs to be greater emphasis on the effective management and use, manipulation and analysis of data, use of statistical and optimisation-tools, including AI, in university undergraduate degree programmes.| Gabin Kayumbi, Adam Sobey | High | In Progress |
| Equality - Diversity - Inclusion in DCE | Katy and Gabin are driving the EDI strategy in data-centric engineering. In addition to complying with, and enforcing the Turing's policies, and actively participating in the Turing's initiatives, DCE is also developing a strategy to address EDI challenges in engineering. Currently, Kimberly Tam is leading a focus on the Maritime sector. | Katy Henderson ; Gabin Kayumbi ; Kimberly Tam | High | In progress | 
| ADViCE | Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation’s Virtual Centre of Excellence (ADViCE) is aimed at the development of innovative artificial intelligence technologies for decarbonisation applications to support the transition to Net Zero. As part of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s (DESNZ) Net Zero Innovation Portfolio, the Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation Programme has been set up to support and promote the adoption of Artificial Intelligence decarbonisation solutions for industries.Part of Stream 1 of this larger (AI for Decarbonisation) innovation programme, Artificial Intelligence for Decarbonisation’s Virtual Centre of Excellence (ADViCE) is aimed at the development of innovative artificial intelligence technologies for decarbonisation applications to support the transition to Net Zero. This stream is being delivered by a collaborative consortium including Digital Catapult, Energy Systems Catapult and the Alan Turing Institute. https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/advice ; Knowledge Base  https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/ADViCE/intro.html ; Forum (tbc) : https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/ADViCE/discussions | Stakeholders: Alice, Fran, Gabin, Adam; Panos; Ruchi. | | In Progress|
| IEEE Conference on AI , Singapore 2024 | 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Sands Expo and Convention Centre.Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 25-27 June 2024. DCE workshop proposal has been accepted. An opportunity to cement data-centric engineering community across an international stage, focusing on the dynamic region of S-E Asia. https://ieeecai.org/2024/ | Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey; Katy | | In progress |
| SMART DESIGN NETWORK | Further refine the overall Concept and options for a Engineering Transformation Network (ETN) – renamed as Smart Design Network. The sub-committee is essentially looking at AI and HPC informing Engineering and Manufacturing. DCE's role is to look at how to bring in aspects of data-centric engineering into the network. https://www.ukri.org/publications/innovate-uk-materials-and-manufacturing-vision-2050/; https://roadmap.ide.uk/ | Drew Hemment; Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey || In Progress |
|IMPERIAL College Centre for Doctoral Trainings - DCE Turing | This is an exciting initiative where Imperial College DCTs is joining efforts with DCE extended industry network to tackle companies challenges in the context of academia-industry collaborations. Applications deriving from domains of interest that include (but not limited to): Statistics & Machine Learning with focus on AI - Data Digitalisation , Engineering & Technology; Computational models and Interface with focus on Physics modelling, Data-Intensive modelling, Research Software Engineering; Mathematics of future climate.| Gabin Kayumbi , Katy Henderson, Federica Pratola (Imp. Coll.) | | In progress |   
| Data Science & AI Skills Mapping | This is part of skills mapping which aims to convene stakeholders (industrialists , academics) to elicit the the outline of skills needed to meet industry need, and identify existing gaps.| Gabin Kayumbi , Katy Henderson | | |
| Maritime Research and Innovation UK (MarRI-UK) | This is an industry-led membership organisation that drives the global competitiveness of the UK maritime through extensive partnerships in identifying, developing, and leveraging emerging technologies. DCE was part of a study on The UK’s Academic Capacity and Capability for Shipbuilding Report funded by the National Shipbuilding Office (NSO). The purpose of this report is to provide an insight into the UK’s current research capabilities, understand what other nations are doing and provide a series of recommendations to industry and government for enhanced competitiveness https://marri-uk.org/index.php/2023/12/13/the-uks-academic-capacity-capability-for-shipbuilding/ | Gabin Kayumbi; Adam Sobey || Completed |
| ODEN Institute - TURING | The over-arching goal is to develop machine learning methods that are aware of the physics of the problem for the realization of real-time digital twins of engineering systems. Applications involve fluid mechanics and nonlinear partial differential equations. Physics-aware machine learning for engineering systems with fluids and nonlinear partial differential equations, while considering the real-time assimilation of data from sensors and robustness of the machine learning algorithms.|Luca Magri; Katy Henderson ; Adam Sobey ; Gabin Kayumbi | | In Progress |
